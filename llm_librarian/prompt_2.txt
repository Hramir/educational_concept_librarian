Thank you for this summary of the video transcript with a list of key concepts! 

Now, please identify any concepts (strings in the "primary concept" or "supporting_concepts" fields) that are redundant with (i.e. equivalent or very similar to) the concepts in our existing library of concepts listed below - we should avoid adding redundant concepts to the list. Here are some examples of redundant or not redundant pairs of concepts: 
1. Variations on words like "eigenvalues" vs eigenvalue" or "linear transformation" vs "linear transform" are redundant
2. "dot product" and "scalar product" are redundant (they refer to the same mathematical operation)
3. "matrix-vector multiplication" and "linear transformation" are not redundant: they represent two different ways of thinking about the same underlying mathematical idea
4. "linearly independent vectors" and "linear independence" are redundant, but "linearly independent rows" is NOT redundant with either of these terms (because it is more specific to thinking about rows of a matrix)
When in doubt, think: "do these concept names represent two distinct ways of thinking (not redundant), or are they just different ways of wording the same thing (redundant)?" Here is the library of concepts to draw from:

Provide your response as a json-formatted dictionary, mapping from concept names that appear in the original list of concepts from the video transcript, to concept names that appear in the concept library above. An example of the correct format would be: {"eigenvalues": "eigenvalue", "scalar product": "dot product"}
