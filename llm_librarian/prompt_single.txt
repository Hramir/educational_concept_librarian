Your task is to construct a hierarchical representation (in JSON format) of a transcript from an educational YouTube video, in terms of "activities" and "concepts." The video includes one or more teaching "activities." The complete set of activities is as follows: 
1. "definition": introducing and explaining a new concept or idea
2. "example": providing an example that illustrates or applies a concept or idea
3. "visualization": using a graph, image, animation, or other visualization to illustrate a concept or idea
4. "application": introducing or discussing a motivating application for a concept or idea
5. "proof": working through a mathematical proof
6. "analogy": drawing an analogy between a new concept or idea and something else the student is likely to be already familiar with 
7. "compare and contrast": comparing and/or contrasting one concept with another
8. "review": reviewing a concept that the student is expected to have some familiarity with already 
9. "other": Any activity that doesn't fit one of the other categories. 
Please ignore any references in the transcript to other videos, textbooks, or other materials (e.g., "check out my next video on...")

Each activity in the video is associated with a single "primary concept," the concept that the activity aims to teach or improve the student’s understanding of. For example, a "definition" of matrix multiplication would have "matrix multiplication" as the primary concept. We will analyze the transcript of a video that teaches the student something related to linear algebra, so examples of suitable concepts would be "dot product", "linear independence", "eigenvector", "change of basis", etc. 

Each activity may also contain one or more supporting concepts that are used to explain the primary concept. For example, a "definition" activity with the primary concept "matrix multiplication" might use the supporting concepts "row", "column", and "dot product" to explain how to calculate each element in the matrix by taking the dot product of rows and columns. Supporting concept names follow the same naming rules as primary concepts. 

It is extremely important that you assign names to both primary concepts and supporting concepts carefully: please try to use concepts names that are reusable in other linear algebra contexts. For example, instead of "matrix B," use a more general term like "matrix." Do not name concepts after specific example problems or applications like "weather modeling" or "COVID-19 pandemic": instead, record the **underlying linear algebra concepts** of these activities (e.g., if a weather modeling example uses singular value decomposition, record "singular value decomposition" as the primary concept). Additionally, try to record concepts in a granular way so that they can be combined to express more complicated concepts. For example, instead of having a complicated concept name like "applying elementary row and column operations to modify determinants", you could have an "application" activity with "determinant" as the primary concept and "elementary row operations" and "elementary column operations" as supporting concepts. Don't use underscores in concept names (use spaces instead). If in doubt, remember that every concept name should not look out of place in a list of linear algebra concepts. 

Each of the activities in the video can also contain one or more activities within them, drawn from the same list above ("definition", "example", "visualization", "application", "proof", "analogy", "compare and contrast", "review", or "other"). For example, the instructor might work through an example problem that involves introducing a motivating application and also uses a graph as part of the problem solving process: this would be an "example" activity that includes "application" and "visualization" activities. 

As an example to guide your analysis, imagine that we have read through a video transcript and summarized it as follows: 

"This video introduces the dot product. The instructor begins by defining the dot product, referring to vector multiplication and linear independence to explain what a dot product is. The instructor then uses a graph visualization to shows how a dot product can be seen as the projection of one vector onto the other multiplied by the magnitude of the other vector. The instructor finishes by introducing a motivating application of the dot product: finding the angle between two vectors. While discussing this application, the instructor shows a visualization of the angle between two vectors, and then works through an example problem using a formula that includes vector magnitudes and the cosine function, explaining how the formula relates to projecting one vector onto another."

A complete hierarchical representation of the example video transcript summarized above would look similar to the following: 

json```
{
  "lesson": [
    {
      "activity": "definition",
      "primary_concept": "dot product",
      "supporting_concepts": ["vector", "addition", "multiplication", "magnitude"],
      "activities": []
    },
    {
      "activity": "visualization",
      "primary_concept": "dot product",
      "supporting_concepts": ["vector", "projection", "multiplication"],
      "activities": []
    },
    {
      "activity": "application",
      "primary_concept": "dot product",
      "supporting_concepts": ["vector", "angle between vectors"],
      "activities": [        
        {
          "activity": "visualization",
          "primary_concept": "dot product",
          "supporting_concepts": ["vector", "angle between vectors"],
          "activities": []
        },
        {
          "activity": "example",
          "primary_concept": "dot product",
          "supporting_concepts": ["vector", "angle between vectors", "projection", "cosine", "magnitude"],
          "activities": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Now that we've seen an example, here is the video transcript you will be analyzing: 

"
<transcript>
"

Begin by writing down a comprehensive summary of the video. Then construct the JSON, making sure to include all activities, primary and supporting concepts associated with each activity, and any sub-activities within each activity. Please remember to only use granular concept names that would not appear out of place in a list of linear algebra concepts (focus on the underlying concepts being taught, not specific examples or applications). Let’s take a deep breath and work on this analysis step by step.
